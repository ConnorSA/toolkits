Notes:
need a sym link in here to a compiled lammps.
expected sym link name: lmp_mpiipcpc


job_IP.sh is a slurm submit script with some example modules.


Program depends on: numpy, ASE


phase_diagram_via_isobars.py: is the driver program where things are controlled for a melt curve.
In here an initial system is built up by reading in a geometry file (e.g. something.castep), and 
then an orthorhombic sturcture is built.

calculate_mu.py: contains the IP class which stores all info needed for a given interface pinning simulation.
Also has the utilities called in the driver to run a given IP simulation.


lammps_input_writer_EAM.py: lammps input file generator and contains the ReadLammps class that handles
reading lammps thermo output to get averaged qauntities.



crystal_driver.py: something to run a crystal NVT. (not really needed).
