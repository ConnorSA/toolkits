A python interface for finding the Gibbs free energy across temperature and pressure.

Gibbs free energy at a given temperature can be found from adiabatic thermodynamic integration, as implemented in LAMMPSvia ti/spring command, this script implements this automatically given MD parameters, a starting structure and desired pressure and temperature.

Temperature dependence of the Gibbs free energy is found via reversible scaling.


LAMMPS is accessed using a static compilation.
